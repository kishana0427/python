				Polymorphism in Python
		===============================
=>Polymorphism is one of the distinct principle in OOPs.
=>The Real Time Purpose of Polymorphism is that "It Provides Efficient Memory Management ".
---------------------------------------
=>Definition of Polymorphism:
---------------------------------------
=>The process of representing "One Form in Multiple Forms" is called Polymorphism .
=>Polymorphism is one best principle but it is not a programming concept.
=>The best principle Polymorphism is implemented ( bring into action ) by using all Object Oriented Programming Languages for getting Efficient Memory Management  .
=>The best principle Polymorphism is implemented in Python by using a Programming concept called "Method / Constructor Overriding".
=>Hence In the definition of Polymorphism, One Form represents Original Method and Multiple Forms represents Overridden methods.
=>A Form is nothing but state of existence of the method. If the Method exist in base class then it is called Original Form/ Method and if it is existing in derived Classes then it is Multiple Forms / Overridden Methods.
=>Hence Polymorphism uses Method Overriding and Method Overriding uses Inheritance
