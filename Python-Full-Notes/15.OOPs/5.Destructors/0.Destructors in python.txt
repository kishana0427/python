			===========================================
					Destructors in Python
						   (or)
					  Garbage Collector 
			===========================================
=>We know that Garbage Collector is one of the background program in python software, which is running with our regular python program and whose purpose is to collect the un-used memory space and improves the performance of Python based Applications.
=>Every Garbage Collector program is internally executing its Destructor program for removing un-used memory space.
=>In general Once the program execution is completed , Garbage Collector program collects the objects memory space automatically by executing Destructor program.
=>If we want to make the Garbage Collector program forcefully to collect any object memory  space then the object must assigned with "None".

		objname=None

=>The syntax for defining Destructor is shown bellow.

		def  __del__(self):
		      -------------------
		      -------------------
		      block of stmts--executed by Garbage Collector
		      ------------------
