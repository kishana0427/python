				Number of approaches to create an object of ndarray
		================================================
=>Dealing with Arrays in Python is nothing but learning about numpy module and 
    ndarray object.
=>In the Numpy Programming, an object of ndrray class is used for organizing the data.
=>In Numpy Programming, we can create an object of ndrray class in 7 ways.
		1) array()
		2) arange()
		3) zeros()
		4) ones()
		5) full()
		6) eye()
		7) identity()
=>All the above Functions are present in numpy module and using the above we can create an object of ndarray.
---------------
1) array():
---------------
=>The array() is used for converting any Iterable object into the object of ndarray.

=>Syntax:-          varname=numpy.array(object,dtype)
=>here varname is an object of <class,'numpy.ndrray'>
=>numpy is one of the third party module 
=>array() is pre-defined function in numpy module
=>object can be list, tuple,set,frozenset..etc
=>dtype represents data type of C lang Internally (int16, int32, int 64, float 32,float64...etc)
------------------
2) arange():
------------------
=>This Function is used for creating 1-D array only  by default and it can't create 2-D and 3-D matrices by deafult. To create 2-D and 3-D matrices, we use reshape() programatically.
=>Syntax1:-  varname=numpy.arange(Value)---> generates values from 0 to value-1
=>Syntax2:-  varname=numpy.arange(start,stop)---->Generates values from Start to Stop-1 
=>Syntax3:-  varname=numpy.arange(start,stop,step)---Generates values from Start to Stop-1												with step values as Interval

---------------
3) zeros():
---------------
=>This function is used for creating zero matrix. In otherwords, This function initlizes all the elements of ndarray object with zero value.

=>Syntax:-  varname=numpy.zeros(shape,dtype)
=>Varname is an object of class ndarray
=>zeros() is pre-defined function in ndarray
=>shape can be 1-D or 2-D or n-D
---------------
4) ones():
---------------
=>This function is used for creating one's matrix. In otherwords, This function initlizes all the elements of ndarray object with one ( 1 ) value.

=>Syntax:-  varname=numpy.ones(shape,dtype)
=>Varname is an object of class ndarray
=>ones() is pre-defined function in ndarray
=>shape can be 1-D or 2-D or n-D
------------
5) full():
------------
=>This function is used used creating a matrix / array of values with programmer choice value. 

=>Syntax:-    varname=numpy.full(shape,fill_value,dtype)
=>Varname is an object of class ndarray
=>full() is pre-defined function in ndarray
=>shape can be 1-D or 2-D or n-D
-------------
6) eye():
-------------
=>This function is used for forming / creating / preparing Identity matrix

=>Syntax:-  varname=numpy.eye(N,M=None,K=0,dtype)
=>here N represents Number of Rows
=>Here M represents Number of Columns and whose default value is None which  Means if we specify N value and Not specifying M value then PVM takes M values as N value and Prepares Identity matrix (where N and M values are equal)
=>If N and M values not equal then PVM Prepares Possible Square Identity Matrix and remaining elements becomes zeros(0s).
=>Here K represents Principle Diagnol and whose default value is Zero(0).
=>If K=-1,-2,-3... then PVM referes Bellow  Principle Diagnol 
=>If K=1,2,3... then PVM referes  above Principle Diagnol 
-----------------
7) identity():
-----------------
=>This is used for creating Identity Matrix only 

=>Syntax:-    varname=numpy.identity(N,dtype)
=>here N repersents Rows and It can be considered as Number of Coumuns also.
=>Note: eye() is an advanced Function for identity()
