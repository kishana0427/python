				Files in Python
		==================================	
=>The purpose of File is that "To achieve the Data Persistency"

=>In the context of files, we have two types of applications. They are
			a) Non-Persistant Applications.
			b) Persistant Applications.

=>In Non-Persistant Application development, we read the inputs from Key board, stored in main Memory , Process the inputs and Result are displayed in Monitor.
=>Whatever the data stored in main memory , it is temporary. 
=>In Persistant Application development, we read the inputs from Key board, stored in main Memory , Process the inputs and Result are stored permanently (Persistantecy).
=>In Industry, we can store the data permanently in two ways. They are
		a) By using Files
		b) By using Database softwares.
