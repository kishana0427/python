				File Opening Modes
		===========================================
=>File Opening Modes makes us to understand, In which mode the file opened.
=>In Python Programming, we have 7 File Opening Modes. They are

----------
1) r :
----------
=>This is one of the default mode.
=>This mode is used for opening the file in read mode.
----------
2) w :
----------
=>This mode is always used for opening the file (new file or existing file)  in write mode always writes the  data newly from begining of the file.
=>If we open the existing file in "w" mode  then existing data replaced with new data .
----------
3) a :
----------
=>This mode is also used for opening the file in write mode .
=> If the file is new file then it opens in write mode and data written newly.
=> If the file is existing file then it opens in write mode  and new data is added at end of existing data of file ( known as appending)
----------
4) r+ :
----------
=>r+ is used for open the file in read mode and performs Read Operation First and later we can perform write operation.
----------
5) w+ :
----------
=>This mode is always used for opening the file (new file or existing file ) in write mode and peforms write operation First and later we can peform read operations also.
=>If we open the existing file in "w" mode  then existing data replaced with new data .
----------
6) a+ :
----------
=>This mode is also used for opening the file in write mode .
=> If the file is new file then it opens in write mode and data written newly.
=> If the file is existing file then it opens in write mode  and new data is added at end of existing data of file ( known as appending) and later we can also read the data from file.
----------
7) x :
----------
=>This mode is used for opening the file in write mode eXclusively.
=>If we open the existing file in X mode then we get FileExistError.
