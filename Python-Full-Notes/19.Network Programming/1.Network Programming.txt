				Network Programming
		=================================
=>The Purpose of Network Programming is that "To share the data / information between two machines "
=>In Network Programming, we develop two types of Programs. They are
		1) Server Side Program
		2) Client Side Program
-------------------------------------------------
1) Definition of Server Side Program:
-------------------------------------------------
=>A Server Side Program is one which accept Client Request, Process the Client Request and Gives Response back to Client Side Program.
-------------------------------------------------
2) Definition of Client Side Program:
-------------------------------------------------
=>A Client Side Program is one, which sends request to the server side propgram and gets the response from Server Side Program.
---------------------------------------------------------------
3) Definition of DNS ( Domain Naming Service):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>The DNS is the name of Physical Machine where Server Side Program Resides
=>The default DNS of every Computer is "localhost"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Definition of IP Address ( Internet Protocal Address):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>The IP Address is the name of Address of the Physical Machine where Server Side Program Resides.
=>The default IP Address of every computer is 127.0.0.1(Loop Back address)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Definition of Port Number:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>A Port Number is a Logical numerical Id, where Server Side Program is Running.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps for developing Server Side Application:
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Every Server Side Program must run at Certain DNS / IP Address and Unique Port 
    Number.
2) Every Server Side  Program ACCEPT the Client  Side Program Request, 
3) Every Server Side  Program must READ client Side Program request, PROCESS 
    the client side program request ( decode() )
4) Server Side Program SEND the response back to Client Side Program ( encode() )
    
Note:- As long as Client Side Program  makes request , The Server Side Program pefroms steps(2), (3) and (4)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps for developing Client Side Application:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Every Client Side Program must get CONNECTION from Server Side Program by 
    passing ( DNS / IP Address , Portno)
2) Every Client Side Program must SEND a request to the Server Side Program 
    (encode() )
3) Every Client Side Program must RECEIVE the response from Server Side Program 
   (decode)

Note:- When Client Side Program want make many request to the server side program  then it has repeat steps (2) and (3)
