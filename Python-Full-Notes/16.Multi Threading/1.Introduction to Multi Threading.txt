			Introduction to Multi Threading
		========================================
=>In the context of OS, we have a concept called Multi Tasking.
=>The main purpose of Multi Threading in python is that "To achieve the Concurrent Execution	(Simultaneous / Parallel Execution ) "
=>Multi Threading is one of the specilized form of Multi Tasking of OS.
=>In this context , we have two types of applications. They are
		a) Process Based Applications
		b) Thread Based Applications.
---------------------------------------------
a) Process Based Applications:
---------------------------------------------
=>Process Based Applications execution environment always contains single thread.
=>Process Based Applications provides Sequential Execution 
=>Process Based Applications takes more execution time
=>Process Based Applications are treated as Heavy weight components.
Examples:- The application of C,CPP...etc are comes under Process Based Applications.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b) Thread Based Applications:
----------------------------------------------
=>Thread Based Applications execution environment always contains multiple  threads for performing multiple Operations concurrently.
=>Thread Based Applications provides concurrent execution.
=>Thread Based Applications takes Less execution time
=>Thread Based Applications are treated as Light weight components.
Examples:-- The application of PYTHON, JAVA...etc are comes under Thread Based Applications.
